# Centrally Deployed Templates Solution (CDTS) version 1.0.0 DevOps with CI/CD

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/shawnthompson/cdts-sgdc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shawnthompson/cdts-sgdc)
[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc#info=devDependencies)

The purpose of the CDTS is essentially to deliver the presentation layer of the Canada.ca theme or Intranet.canada.ca theme to web assets. It decouples the presentation layer from the business logic of a static website or web application and allows rapid updates across multiple networks.

This project is to change the present CDTS into a system that builds and tests with each commit and a way to deploy the artifacts to servers.

The _soy_ files are compiled with [soynode](https://github.com/Medium/soynode).

## Working with this repository

### Requirements

To work with this project you will need node.js and npm installed. This project was created with:

* node.js v12.14.0
* npm 6.13.4

**For ESDC employees** behind *proxy.prv* if you haven't worked in git before you need to create a file with the code from [proxy-config.bat](proxy-config.bat) and run it, before cloning. 

### Security

#### Verifying commits

This project will need you to use GPG to verify commits. Please read [About commit signature verification](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-commit-signature-verification).

#### Two Factor Authentication (2FA)

All members to this project will need to have 2FA enabled to merge any code into the repository. Read more about [Securing your account with two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) on the Github site. 


#### Install dependencies
Clone this repository to a local directory. On the command line move to the cloned directory ( this directory should contain the package.json file) and run : `$ npm install`.
This command will read the package.json and install the npm dependencies to the *node_modules* directory.

#### Builds

This project uses the [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) modules to build and minify the final JavaScript modules.

#### Development
To create a development build of the modules on the command line move to the cloned directory and run: `$ npm run build`

This command will:

1. Empty the `dist` and `tmp` folder
2. Compile the soy files with [soynode](https://github.com/Medium/soynode)
3. Cop and rename the compiled `js` files into the `dist` with [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra)
4. Copy the `gcweb` and `wet-boew` files from the `node_modules` folder in the `dist` 
5. Copy all the other assets (JS, CSS, HTML) files from the `_src` in the `dist`
6. Delete the `tmp` folder

#### To Do:

* Use **node** to minify / uglify files, try [https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js](uglify-js), added issue [#6](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/6)
* Setup git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for sample pages, added issue [#7](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/7)
* Use a CI to tests source code, added issue [#8](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/8)
* Use CI to deploy `dist` folder to servers, added issue [#9](https://github.com/wet-boew/cdts-sgdc/issues/9)

#### NPM scripts breakdown

##### "build": "npm-run-all clean --parallel gc* copy --sequential cleanup"

Builds the full ./dist. 

##### "copy": "node ./scripts/copy.js"

Used to copy all the dependant files to ./dist

##### "clean": "node ./scripts/clean.js"

Empty the folders to before the full build. To make sure there's no conflicts or anything cached

##### "cleanup": "node ./scripts/cleanup.js"

Deleted the tmp folder created by a build

##### "gcweb-en": "node ./scripts/build-gcweb-en.js"

Compiles the English soy files for GCWeb 

##### "gcweb-fr": "node ./scripts/build-gcweb-fr.js"

Compiles the French soy files for GCWeb 

##### "gcintranet-en": "node ./scripts/build-gcintranet-en.js"

Compiles the English soy files for GCIntranet 

##### "gcintranet-fr": "node ./scripts/build-gcintranet-fr.js"

Compiles the French soy files for GCIntranet 

##### "getwet": "node ./scripts/getwet.js"

Pulls the wet-boew files needed

## Nice to have

* Sass or post-css
* Something to generate the sample HTML files (jekyll)

## New DNS structure

We would like to setup a new DNS new path for the CDTS JS files.

Looking at maybe one of these:

* sgdc-cdts.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
* cdts.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
* sgdc.canada.ca/v1.0.1/cdts/js/gcweb-en.js
